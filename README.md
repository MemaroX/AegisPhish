- **Content Analysis:** Extracts and cleans text, scans for suspicious keywords, and analyzes URL patterns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Generates features based on URL reputation, domain analysis, sender behavior, and email structure.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilizes models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to classify emails as "phishing" or "legitimate".
- **REST API:** Provides simple endpoints for email submission and analysis results.
